      Come on, come on
      I see no changes, wake up in the morning, and I ask myself
      Is life worth living, should I blast myself?
      I'm tired of bein' poor, and even worse I'm black
      My stomach hurts, so I'm lookin' for a purse to snatch
      Cops give a damn about a negro
      Pull the trigger, kill a nigga, he's a hero
      Give the crack to the kids who the hell cares
      One less hungry mouth on the welfare
      First, ship 'em dope and let 'em deal the brothers
      Give 'em guns, step back, watch 'em kill each other
      It's time to fight back, that's what Huey said
      Two shots in the dark, now Huey's dead
      I got love for my brother, but we can never go nowhere
      Unless we share with each other
      We gotta start makin' changes
      Learn to see me as a brother instead of two distant strangers
      And that's how it's supposed to be
      How can the devil take a brother, if he's close to me?
      I'd love to go back to when we played as kids
      But things changed, and that's the way it is
      Come on, come on
      That's just the way it is
      Things will never be the same
      That's just the way it is
      Ooh, yeah
      Come on, come on
      That's just the way it is
      Things will never be the same
      That's just the way it is
      Aww, yeah
      I see no changes, all I see is racist faces
      Misplaced hate makes disgrace to races
      We under, I wonder what it takes to make this
      One better place, let's erase the wasted
      Take the evil out the people, they'll be acting right
      'Cause mo' black and white is smokin' crack tonight
      And only time we chill is when we kill each other
      It takes skill to be real, time to heal each other
      And although it seems heaven sent
      We ain't ready, to see a black President
      It ain't a secret, don't conceal the fact
      The penitentiary's packed, and it's filled with blacks
      But some things will never change
      Try to show another way but you stayin' in the dope game
      Now tell me, what's a mother to do?
      Bein' real don't appeal to the brother in you
      You gotta operate the easy way
      (I made a G today) But you made it in a sleazy way
      Sellin' crack to the kid (I gotta get paid)
      Well, hey, well, that's the way it is
      Come on, come on
      That's just the way it is
      Things will never be the same
      That's just the way it is
      Aww, yeah
      Come on, come on
      That's just the way it is
      Things will never be the same
      That's just the way it is
      Aww, yeah
      We gotta make a change
      It's time for us as a people to start makin' some changes
      Let's change the way we eat
      Let's change the way we live
      And let's change the way we treat each other
      You see, the old way wasn't working so it's on us to do
      What we gotta do, to survive
      And still I see no changes, can't a brother get a little peace?
      There's war in the streets and war in the Middle East
      Instead of war on poverty, they got a war on drugs
      So the police can bother me
      And I ain't never did a crime, I ain't have to do
      But now, I'm back with the facts givin' 'em back to you
      Don't let 'em jack you up, back you up
      Crack you up and pimps smack you up
      You gotta learn to hold ya own
      They get jealous when they see ya, with ya mobile phone
      But tell the cops, they can't touch this
      I don't trust this, when they try to rush, I bust this
      That's the sound of my tool, you say it ain't cool?
      But mama didn't raise no fool
      And as long as I stay black, I gotta stay strapped
      And I never get to lay back
      'Cause I always got to worry 'bout the pay backs
      Some buck that I roughed up way back
      Comin' back after all these years
      Rat-a-tat, tat, tat, tat, that's the way it is
      That's just the way it is
      Things will never be the same
      That's just the way it is (Way it is)
      Aww, yeah
      That's just the way it is
      Things will never be the same
      That's just the way it is
      Aww, yeah
      Some things will never change

      There must be some kind of way outta here
      Said the joker to the thief
      There's too much confusion
      I can't get no relief
      Business men, they drink my wine
      Plowmen dig my earth
      None will level on the line
      Nobody offered his word
      Hey, hey
      No reason to get excited
      The thief, he kindly spoke
      There are many here among us
      Who feel that life is but a joke
      But, uh, but you and I, we've been through that
      And this is not our fate
      So let us stop talkin' falsely now
      The hour's getting late, hey
      Hey
      All along the watchtower
      Princes kept the view
      While all the women came and went
      Barefoot servants, too
      Well, uh, outside in the cold distance
      A wildcat did growl
      Two riders were approaching
      And the wind began to howl, hey
      All along the watchtower
      All along the watchtower

      This is the end
      Beautiful friend
      This is the end
      My only friend, the end
      Of our elaborate plans, the end
      Of everything that stands, the end
      No safety or surprise, the end
      I'll never look into your eyes again
      Can you picture what will be
      So limitless and free
      Desperately in need of some stranger's hand
      In a desperate land
      This is the end
      Beautiful friend
      This is the end
      My only friend, the end
      It hurts to set you free
      But you'll never follow me
      The end of laughter and soft lies
      The end of nights we tried to die
      This is the end
      This is the end
